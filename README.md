Investigates which demographic, lifestyle, and medical factors influence the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease.

Data Source
The dataset I am using, Alzheimer’s Disease Dataset (Rabie El Kharoua), is publicly available on Kaggle.com, a platform for sharing open datasets and data science projects. The dataset was uploaded by its creator, Rabie El Kharoua, who has made it openly accessible for research, analysis, and educational purposes. Because the dataset is hosted on Kaggle as an open-source dataset, it is free to download and use under Kaggle’s terms of service. Kaggle allows students, researchers, and professionals to apply data analysis techniques on these datasets if the work is for learning, research, or non-commercial purposes.
The dataset can be retrieved directly from the Kaggle website as a CSV file. It includes 2,149 observations and multiple variables across three categories: demographic (age, gender, education, ethnicity), lifestyle (BMI, diet, exercise, smoking, alcohol, sleep quality), and medical (family history, comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, depression, history of head injury, cognitive test scores, and Alzheimer’s diagnosis).
